## Posterior comparisons

Comparisons of the posterior based on 4 chains with 1000 posterior samples. Summary reports also include potential issues during sampling.

```{python}
def compare_scheme(model, kernels, reference=None):
    results = sample_scheme(model, kernels, num_chains=4)
    summary = gs.Summary(results)

    if reference is not None:
        summary_df = summary._param_df().iloc[:, 1:6]
        reference_df = reference._param_df().iloc[:, 1:6]
        diff = summary_df - reference_df
    else:
        diff = None

    return summary, diff
```

### IWLS-Gibbs

```{python}
#| results: hide

summary_iwls_gibbs, diff = compare_scheme(model1, kernels_iwls_gibbs)
```

```{python}
summary_iwls_gibbs
```

### NUTS-Gibbs

```{python}
#| results: hide

summary, diff = compare_scheme(model1, kernels_nuts_gibbs, summary_iwls_gibbs)
```

```{python}
summary
```

#### Absolute differences between NUTS-Gibbs and IWLS-Gibbs

```{python}
diff
```

### NUTS1

```{python}
#| results: hide

summary, diff = compare_scheme(model2, kernels_nuts1, summary_iwls_gibbs)
```

#### Absolute differences between NUTS1 and IWLS-Gibbs

```{python}
diff
```

### NUTS2

```{python}
#| results: hide

summary, diff = compare_scheme(model2, kernels_nuts2, summary_iwls_gibbs)
```

```{python}
